# OG2RR DMB Converter

This program converts `descr_model_battle.txt` (DMB) from _Rome: Total War_ (OG) to _Total War: Rome Remastered_ (RR).

## Notes

For convenience, the converter sets the `pbr_texture` for all models to `data/characters/textures/generic_pbr.tga`. If you wish to add custom PBR textures to models, please modify the relevant line manually after conversion.

If any models are missing textures, the program will inform the user after conversion. A text file listing which models are missing textures will be saved as `og2rr_log.txt`.
